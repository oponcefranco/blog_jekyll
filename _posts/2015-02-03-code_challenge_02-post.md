## Welcome back to our bi-weekly Code Challenge!

#### Big thanks to all who participated in our first meeting. I'll be posting shortly a few of the solutions from our group. Also, I want to thank Andrey Izotov for the great presentation on [Ruby Blocks]({{ site.url }}/images/intro_to_ruby_blocks.pdf).

## Madlibs Challenge
### Required Basic Features

This week's Code Challenge is to write a program that presents the user with Madlibs. The script should ask the user for a series of words, then fill in the proper places in the story using the user's answers. Madlibs are really just a templating problem and that comes up in many aspects of programming. We'll keep our story format very simple, using a ((...)) notation for placeholders. Here's an example:

```
Our favorite language is ((a gemstone)).
```

If your program is fed that template, it should ask you to enter "a gemstone" and then display your version of the story. You can choose any interface you like (terminal or GUI), as long as the end user can interact with the end result. 

```
Our favorite language is Ruby.
```

### Madlib text:


```
	  For my ((a family member))'s ((an event)) present about ((a number)) years ago,
	  I got him a ((gift:a noun)).   Not a ((an adjective)) ((gift)) or a loud one or
	  even a ((an adjective)) ((gift)) that runs around chasing its ((a body part))
	  and drooling on the ((a noun)).  I got them a ((a proper noun)), bred in China
	  thousands of years ago to be the ((a plural noun)) of the royal family.  
	  We named it ((a proper name)).
```
