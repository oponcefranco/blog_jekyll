## API Tutorial

An *API* (Application Programming Interface) is a set of methods and tools that can be used for building software applications.
Here is a better way to think about it: When you did standardized testing in high school, you learned how to fill in the bubbles with a _#2 pencil_ because thatâ€™s what the scoring machine could detect. The questions and answers always varied but the way you interacted with them was to fill in the bubble with a _#2 pencil_. You can think of an API as this bubble sheet. A standard way to exchange information between things.

### HTTP

`HTTP` requests are the building blocks of web APIs. Your job is to program as if you were the browser, making the request and handling the returned data. `HTTP` is a set of instructions for sending and retrieving data.

### Query parameters

Many APIs use this format for material, you can then filter particular information using query parameters. *Query parameters* are those things you see at the end of the URL: `?bundles=true`. Many APIs use these query parameters as filter.

### Postman

##### Install App
Let's start by installing the [Postman App](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).
#### Manage Environments
Now, add one or more environments for your testing.

* click on gear icon (top right corner)
* click on *Add* button
* enter *Environment Name*, e.g., `staging4`
* enter *key*, e.g., `staging4`
* enter *value*, e.g., `https://staging4.honestqa.com`

#### Add HTTP request example
Create a folder for our `http` requests.

* click on *folder* icon to create a new collection (side panel)
* enter *Name*, _"REST API requests"_
* click on *Create* button

Create `http` request. (this is a perfect time to read about [HTTP Request Methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html))

* select `http request method`, `POST`
* enter `API` endpoint, `{{staging4}}/api/v1/users`
** _we're using the environment variable that we created earlier_
* click on `Headers` tab and add the following:
** `key: Content-Type value: application/json`
** `key: Honest-BU value: thc`

* click on `Body` tab
* select the `raw` radial button option
* select `JSON(application/json)` from the drop-down selector

#### REST API requests

* create user (see example above)
* oauth request
* create cart
* add bundle to cart
* charge cart

#### NGPAPI requests

* subscriptions
* edit subscription instance
* apply coupon
