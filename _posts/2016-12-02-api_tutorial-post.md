## API Tutorial

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of methods and tools that can be used for building software applications.
Here is a better way to think about it: When you did standardized testing in high school, you learned how to fill in the bubbles with a #2 pencil because thatâ€™s what the scoring machine could detect. The questions and answers always varied but the way you interacted with them was to fill in the bubble with a #2 pencil. You can think of an API as this bubble sheet. A standard way to exchange information between things.

### HTTP

HTTP requests are the building blocks of web APIs. Your job is to program as if you were the browser, making the request and handling the returned data. HTTP is a set of instructions for sending and retrieving data.

### Query parameters

Many APIs use this format for material, you can then filter particular information using query parameters. Query parameters are those things you see at the end of the URL: ?bundles=true. Many APIs use these query parameters as filter.
